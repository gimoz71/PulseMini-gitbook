# Layered Interpretation

The Pulse Method does not analyse the market as a single block. It separates behaviour into layers so that each dimension of structure becomes readable on its own — and even more powerful when combined.

Layered interpretation allows you to:

* avoid analysing everything at once
* avoid reacting to single-indicator impulses
* understand conditions instead of isolated signals
* see how behaviours align or diverge across the market

This is what makes Pulse engines intuitive: each layer expresses one type of information, and clarity emerges from their interaction rather than from any single element.

### How Layered Interpretation Works

Pulse Mini uses three simplified layers:

#### Trend — Direction of Movement

This layer identifies whether the market is moving upward, downward, or losing direction. It establishes the broad environment in which all other behaviours occur.

#### Phase — Quality of Movement

Phase reflects whether the market is expanding, contracting, or transitioning. A clean expansion supports trend clarity; unstable phases signal caution.

#### Timing — Rhythm of Movement

Timing captures micro-structure and short-term behaviour. It confirms whether immediate momentum supports or contradicts the broader structure.

Each layer answers a different question:

* **Trend:** “Where is the market going?”
* **Phase:** “How is it moving?”
* **Timing:** “Is the moment stable or unstable?”

### Why Layers Matter

Relying on a single variable — a trend indicator, an oscillator, a volatility measure — makes interpretation fragile. Layers solve this by creating a structural hierarchy:

* **Trend** provides context
* **Phase** evaluates structure
* **Timing** validates moment-to-moment behaviour

When these layers align, the market is usually clearer and more structured. When they diverge, noise increases, and Pulse naturally becomes more conservative.

### Consistency across Engines

Layered interpretation is identical across the entire Pulse ecosystem:

* Mini uses simplified layers
* Essential expands structural depth
* Pro multiplies resolution and intelligence

But the method — the way the market is read — never changes.

Pulse Mini is the first expression of this layered approach, delivered in its cleanest form.
