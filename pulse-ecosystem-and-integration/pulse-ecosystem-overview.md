# Pulse Ecosystem Overview

Pulse is built around **one method**. Every component in the ecosystem is simply a deeper or broader expression of the same structural logic.

This chapter provides a minimal orientation, helping readers understand how **Pulse Mini** fits into the larger framework.

***

### Pulse Mini — Entry-Level Structural Engine

**Status:** Released\
**Role:** First expression of the method

**Pulse Mini** focuses on:

* directional behaviour
* clear structural reading
* noise reduction
* trend–phase–timing alignment

Mini avoids sideways or compression-heavy environments to maintain maximum clarity. It is also **permanently free**, serving as the accessible entry point to the entire ecosystem.

***

### Pulse Essential — Extended Structural Map

**Status:** In planning **Role:** Intermediate structural engine

Essential expands Mini’s logic by adding:

* horizontal structure (ranges, compression)
* more refined phase analysis
* accumulation/redistribution behaviour
* deeper detection of context

It completes the **basic structural map** of the market.

***

### Pulse Pro — Full-Depth Structural Intelligence

**Status:** In engineering design\
**Role:** Advanced structural engine

Pulse Pro will offer:

* multi-layer behavioural interpretation
* higher-resolution timing
* refined transitions
* expanded structural context

Designed for users who require maximum analytical depth and professional-grade market intelligence.

***

### Pulse Dashboard — Operational Intelligence Layer

**Status:** In architectural research\
**Role:** Execution & risk-management surface

The Dashboard will provide:

* risk management
* position sizing
* exposure controls
* liquidity checks
* signal orchestration
* workflow automation

It sits _above_ the engines and does not alter their logic — it organises how signals are used.

***

### Shared Philosophy across All Engines

Despite their differences in depth, Mini, Essential, Pro, and Dashboard all follow the **same core method**:

* behavioural reading
* layered interpretation
* structural clarity
* non-predictive logic
* clean separation between analysis and execution

This consistency is what makes Pulse scalable, stable, and easy to adopt across roles, from discretionary traders to bot developers.

### Why the Ecosystem Matters

As users progress:

* Mini teaches clarity
* Essential expands structure
* Pro deepens intelligence
* Dashboard completes workflow

Each component builds on the previous without changing the underlying method. This makes the entire ecosystem future-proof and easy to grow with.
