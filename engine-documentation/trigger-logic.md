# Trigger Logic

Pulse Mini does **not** generate signals using traditional indicators, fixed rules, or mechanical triggers. Instead, it waits for a **natural alignment** across its three structural layers:

* Trend
* Phase
* Timing

A trigger is simply the moment when the market expresses a clean structure across all layers at once.

Pulse Mini never anticipates movement — it confirms **what is structurally true right now**.

### What Triggers Represent

A trigger is the result of:

* directional clarity (Trend)
* structural stability (Phase)
* momentary alignment (Timing)

When these elements support each other, the environment becomes coherent enough for the engine to highlight it.

Triggers are **not** buy/sell commands. They are **structural confirmations**.

### What Triggers Are Not

Triggers are **not**:

* predictions
* forecasts
* guarantees of continuation
* attempts to catch every move
* reactions to micro-noise

They do not tell you “price will go up”. They tell you: **“The environment is currently structured and favourable.”**

This separation is essential.

### When Triggers Are Likely to Appear

Triggers tend to appear when:

* the trend is stable
* the phase is in clean expansion
* timing supports continuation
* context shows consistent behaviour
* swings display coherence

In other words: when the market is behaving cleanly.

Pulse Mini highlights these moments because they represent high-quality structural clarity.

### When Triggers Are Unlikely to Appear

Triggers become rare when:

* the trend weakens or flattens
* price compresses
* the phase shows unstable transitions
* timing hesitates or becomes reactive
* volatility behaves irrationally

Pulse Mini prefers **neutrality** over forcing signals. This is what keeps the engine non-repainting and stable.

### Why Pulse Mini Doesn't Fire Often in Noisy Environments

Low-frequency, high-quality structural confirmations are intentional.

Pulse Mini avoids:

* chaotic moments
* fake breakouts
* inconsistent behaviour
* micro-swings that mislead traders

This keeps signals meaningful and prevents impulsive trading.

### How Traders Should Interpret Triggers

A trigger does _not_ mean “Enter now”. It means “The environment is structurally favourable. If your strategy has a valid entry here, conditions support it.”

It is your responsibility to:

* apply your strategy
* define risk
* manage trades
* decide whether to act

Pulse provides structure. You provide intent.

### Summary

Trigger Logic is simple:

* **Trend** → direction
* **Phase** → structural quality
* **Timing** → momentary stability
* **Alignment** → trigger

Triggers reflect the moment when structure is clean — nothing more, nothing less.

Pulse Mini does not predict. It recognises coherence.
