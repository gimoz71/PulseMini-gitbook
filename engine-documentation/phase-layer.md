# Phase Layer

The Phase Layer reveals **how** the market is moving within its structure. While the Trend Layer shows direction, the Phase Layer shows the **quality** of that movement.

It tells you whether the market is:

* expanding
* contracting
* consolidating
* transitioning

Understanding the phase helps you avoid difficult environments and focus on moments where behaviour is clean and organised.

### Expansion Phase

Expansion is when the market moves with clarity and consistency.

Characteristics:

* smooth price flow
* stable volatility
* directional momentum
* coherent swings
* clean structural development

Expansion phases typically produce:

* clearer opportunities
* better alignment across layers
* fewer false impulses

Pulse Mini becomes more expressive in expansion.

### Contraction Phase

Contraction is where the market compresses and loses structural quality.

Characteristics:

* tight ranges
* inconsistent swings
* volatility flattening
* stalled momentum
* micro-noise dominance

During contraction:

* signals decrease
* alignment is rare
* instability increases
* better to wait than to act

Contraction is where traders often force trades — Pulse Mini avoids these traps.

### Transition Phase

Transition occurs when the market shifts from expansion to contraction or vice versa.

Characteristics:

* volatility shifts abruptly
* timing becomes unstable
* trend signals hesitate
* structure breaks and reforms quickly

Transitions are inherently unstable.

Pulse Mini treats them conservatively because:

* behaviour is inconsistent
* direction is unclear
* momentum fragments
* timing becomes unreliable

Transitions require patience, not action.

### Why Phase Matters

Phase determines:

* the strength of the environment
* the likelihood of clean timing
* the reliability of trend development
* whether structure is forming or breaking

Without understanding the phase, traders operate blind — entering during the worst possible conditions.

Pulse Mini makes phase behaviour visible and readable.

### How Traders Use the Phase Layer

Traders use phase to:

* avoid compression and mid-phase instability
* favour clean expansions
* detect early signs of regime change
* judge the quality of the current environment
* understand when structure is at risk

Phase answers the question: **“Is the market moving cleanly or not?”**

### Summary

The Phase Layer is the structural quality filter of the Pulse Method.

* Expansion → supportive
* Contraction → unstable
* Transition → caution

Trend gives direction. Phase reveals quality. Both must be read together for a complete structural picture.
