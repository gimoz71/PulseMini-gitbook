# What Pulse Mini Does Not Do

Pulse Mini is a **market-reading engine**, not a bot, not a prediction tool, and not a shortcut to profits. Its role is to give you clarity — not to execute, forecast, or manage risk.

Here is what Pulse Mini does **not** do.

### No Predictions, No Forecasting

Pulse Mini does **not**:

* predict future prices
* anticipate outcomes
* use statistical projection or regression
* promise profits or guaranteed results

The engine shows what the market is doing _now_, not what it _might_ do.

### No Execution or Portfolio Control

Pulse Mini does **not**:

* execute trades
* open/close positions
* manage TP/SL
* size positions
* interact with exchanges
* hold or move funds

It is not a trading bot. It does not replace personal discipline or risk management.

### No Market Forcing or Over-Signalling

Pulse Mini does **not**:

* try to catch every move
* fire signals in chaotic environments
* attempt to dominate the chart
* override your strategy
* push you to act

It stays neutral when the market is unclear.

### No Indicator-Based Logic

Pulse Mini does **not** rely on:

* oscillators
* moving averages
* smoothing formulas
* lagging indicators
* arbitrary trigger rules

Its logic is structural and behavioural, not formula-driven.

### No Visual Overload

Pulse Mini is built on the philosophy of the **Strategic Ghost Engine**:

* it stays lightweight
* it does not overwhelm the chart
* it highlights only the essential structure
* it reduces visual complexity

The engine works _with_ your chart, not _on top_ of it.

### No Interference With Your Workflow

Pulse Mini never:

* changes your existing strategy
* modifies your indicators
* interferes with execution tools
* requires additional software

It remains a clean, independent layer of market interpretation.
