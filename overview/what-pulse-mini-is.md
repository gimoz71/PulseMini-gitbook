# What Pulse Mini Is

### A Lightweight Directional Engine

***

**Pulse Mini** is a strictly trend-following engine. It does not trade sideways markets or compression zones — this is intentional. Mini focuses exclusively on directional structure to keep clarity at its highest.

**Pulse Mini** is a lightweight multi-layer market engine designed to help traders read crypto price action with more clarity and less noise.

It runs directly on TradingView and provides stable, non-repainting signals that highlight market structure, trend shifts, and timing windows without overwhelming the chart.

### Not a Traditional Indicator

**Pulse Mini** is not an indicator in the traditional sense. It does not rely on oscillators, moving averages, or guesswork.

Instead, it reads the behaviour of the market through three simplified layers — Trend, Phase, and Timing — and shows only the conditions that matter for structured decision-making.

### Purpose of Pulse Mini

The goal is simple: to give you a cleaner, more objective view of what the market is doing right now, so you can trade with more confidence and fewer impulsive decisions.

**Pulse Mini** does not predict the future and does not promise profits. It offers a clearer lens — an organized framework that helps you understand market context faster and avoid low-quality setups.

### The Entry Point into the Pulse Ecosystem

**Pulse Mini** is the first entry point into the Pulse ecosystem: a practical, focused engine that helps traders move from reactive trading to structured, context-driven decisions.

It is built around the philosophy of clarity, stability, and behavioural reading — the foundational layer upon which Essential and Pro will expand.
