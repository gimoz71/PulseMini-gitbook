# Mini Decision Flow

**Pulse Mini** does not rely on rigid rules or mechanical triggers. Instead, it reads how the **Trend**, **Phase**, and **Timing** layers interact in real time and highlights environments where structure is naturally clearer.

The engine acts only when the market behaves coherently.

***

### Step 1 — Check the Trend

The engine evaluates whether:

* the trend is stable
* the direction is clear
* the rhythm is consistent

If the trend weakens, becomes flat, or turns conflicting, clarity drops and caution increases.

***

### Step 2 — Check the Phase

The engine assesses whether the market is:

* expanding
* contracting
* consolidating
* transitioning

Clean expansion supports the structure. Compression or mid-phase instability often reduces signal quality.

***

### Step 3 — Check the Timing

Timing reflects short-term behaviour:

* **strong timing** → supports continuation
* **weak timing** → signals hesitation or exhaustion

Even in a clear trend, poor timing weakens the environment.

***

### Step 4 — Look for Alignment

Alignment is the core of **Pulse Mini**. The engine highlights clearer conditions only when:

* Trend
* Phase
* Timing

…naturally support each other.

Aligned layers lead to a structured environment. Divergent layers lead to noise, instability, and caution.

**Pulse Mini** prefers neutrality over forcing signals — this is what keeps it stable and **non-repainting**.

### You Don’t Need to Memorise Anything

The decision flow becomes intuitive as you watch the engine in real time.

**Pulse Mini** reduces the decision-making process to a few clear observations:

* Is the trend aligned?
* Is the phase clean?
* Is timing supportive?

The engine’s behaviour teaches you the flow naturally.
