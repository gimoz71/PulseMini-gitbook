# Understanding Your Tools

Pulse Mini works on top of TradingView and focuses on reading the market with clarity and consistency. It does not execute trades, manage positions, or take autonomous actions. This separation is intentional — Pulse Mini is designed to **think**, not to act.

### Pulse Mini’s Role

Pulse Mini provides:

* structural reading
* trend interpretation
* phase recognition
* timing behaviour
* noise reduction
* clean, non-repainting context

It is the **intelligence layer** of your workflow.

Pulse Mini shows when the environment makes sense — nothing more, nothing less.

### TradingView as the Visual Surface

TradingView is the environment where:

* charts are displayed
* market structure appears
* layers are visualised
* alerts are triggered

Pulse Mini uses TradingView to express the structure clearly. No extra software is required.

### Automation Tools and Their Role

If you choose to automate, external tools can act on Pulse Mini’s alerts.

The most common example is **3Commas**, which can:

* execute buy/sell orders
* manage SmartTrades
* handle DCA logic
* react to webhook payloads

However:

* 3Commas does **not** read the market
* 3Commas does **not** understand Trend, Phase, or Timing
* 3Commas only **executes** what Pulse confirms

This keeps the workflow clean:

**Pulse Mini reads → TradingView alerts → 3Commas executes** (optional)

### Benefits of This Separation

This modular design prevents:

* signal distortion
* execution bias
* accidental automation errors
* overlapping logic
* behavioural interference

You keep full control over:

* your execution
* your strategy
* your automation settings
* your risk parameters

Pulse Mini remains independent and consistent in all conditions.

### Manual and Automated Users Both Benefit

Whether you trade manually or through automation:

* Pulse Mini filters out bad conditions
* highlights clear structural moments
* keeps you aligned with behaviour
* prevents impulsive decisions
* simplifies your workflow

The engine adapts to you — not the other way around.
