# Before You Start

Pulse Mini runs directly on TradingView. You do **not** need additional software, complex installations, or special technical knowledge.

Before adding the engine to your chart, make sure you have the following:

### TradingView Account

Any TradingView plan works:

* Free
* Pro
* Pro+
* Premium

Pulse Mini works without restrictions on all plans.

### Stable Internet Connection

Pulse Mini relies on TradingView data. A stable connection ensures:

* smooth chart updates
* clean layer rendering
* reliable alert behaviour

### Basic TradingView Familiarity

You should know how to:

* change symbols
* switch timeframes
* access the indicator panel
* open the alert creation window

If you can use TradingView casually, you can use Pulse Mini.

### Optional Tools

These are **optional**, not required:

* **Telegram** → for receiving notifications or community updates
* **3Commas** → if you want to automate signals using webhooks
* **Other automation tools** → only if you plan to integrate Pulse Mini externally

Pulse Mini is designed to be simple. No indicators, plugins, datasets, or scripts are required.

### No Technical Knowledge Needed

You do **not** need:

* advanced technical analysis
* Pine Script knowledge
* algorithmic trading experience
* bot infrastructure

If you can read a chart, you can use Pulse Mini. Understanding structure will come quickly as you watch the layers in real time.
