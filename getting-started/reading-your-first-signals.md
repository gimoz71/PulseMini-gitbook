# Reading Your First Signals

Once Pulse Mini is active on your chart, you will begin to see how the engine organises market behaviour through its three simplified layers. You don’t need to interpret everything at once — the engine is designed to guide your eye naturally.

### Start with the Trend

The **Trend layer** is the broadest and shapes your first impression of the environment.

A clean, stable trend usually means:

* clearer directional behaviour
* fewer false impulses
* better overall structure

If the trend is weakening, flattening, or shifting, the environment may become less favourable.

### Observe the Market Phase

The **Phase layer** shows how the market is moving inside the trend:

* expansion
* contraction
* consolidation
* transition

This helps you identify areas to avoid, especially:

* compression zones
* unstable mid-phases
* irregular structures

When the phase is clean, the structure becomes easier to read.

### Notice Timing Windows

The **Timing layer** reflects the micro-structure of momentum:

* strong timing → supports continuation
* weak timing → signals hesitation or temporary exhaustion

Even in a clean trend, poor timing reduces the quality of entries.

### Watch for Natural Alignment

Pulse Mini does **not** generate signals from a single condition. Signals appear only when multiple structural elements align naturally.

This is what gives the engine:

* stability
* non-repainting behaviour
* low noise
* consistent interpretation

Aligned layers lead to cleaner conditions. Divergent layers lead to a noisy or uncertain environment.

### Take Your Time

You don’t need to rush into trades. Spend some time watching how the three layers interact as the price moves. You will quickly see how Pulse Mini helps:

* filter out impulsive entries
* avoid noise
* wait for higher-quality moments
* stay aligned with real behaviour

The more you observe, the more intuitive the engine becomes.
