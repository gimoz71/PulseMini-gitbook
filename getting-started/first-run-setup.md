# First-Run Setup

When you add Pulse Mini to your chart for the first time, the engine loads with a default configuration that works for most traders. There are only a few key steps to check before you begin using it effectively.

### Choose a Recommended Market

For the cleanest structural behaviour, switch to one of the core, high-liquidity markets:

* BTC/USDT
* ETH/USDT
* SOL/USDT
* XRP/USDT
* BNB/USDT

These pairs offer smoother structure, clearer trend development and more consistent timing behaviour.

### Select a Clear Timeframe

Pulse Mini adapts to any timeframe, but clarity increases on stable time horizons.

**Recommended**:

* **1H – 2H – 4H**

**Optional**:

* **1D** for macro context
* **15m – 30m** for more detail after gaining familiarity

No internal settings need to be changed.

### Keep Your Chart Simple

Pulse Mini is designed to give you a clean structural view.\
If your chart is overloaded with:

* indicators
* drawings
* outdated tools

…the engine still works, but the readability suffers.

A simple chart reveals Pulse Mini’s behaviour instantly.

### Verify Layer Visibility

Pulse Mini displays all layers automatically:

* **Trend**
* **Phase**
* **Timing**

If something looks unusual, refresh the chart or remove/re-add the engine.

### Everything Is Ready

After completing these steps, Pulse Mini is fully operational.

You can now:

* observe how the structure forms
* watch how signals behave in real time
* understand behaviour as price moves
* start building your reading workflow

Nothing else is required.
