# Learn

Pulse Mini is built to read what the market is _actually_ doing — not what traditional indicators assume, predict or interpret through formulas.

The goal of this section is to help you understand:

* how Pulse interprets structure
* why its approach differs from classical indicators
* how to think in terms of behaviour rather than prediction

Pulse Mini reduces noise and highlights the elements of market behaviour that consistently matter for decision-making.

### Behaviour Over Prediction

Traditional indicators often rely on:

* mathematical smoothing
* lagging formulas
* moving averages
* oscillators
* thresholds and synthetic signals

These tools try to approximate behaviour through calculations, often reacting late or producing conflicting readings.

Pulse Mini takes a different approach:

* it observes structure directly
* it reads behaviour as it forms
* it focuses on the present, not the forecast
* it highlights clarity and suppresses noise

No predictions. No econometric modelling. Just structural awareness.

### Why Behaviour Matters

Markets behave in recurring structural patterns:

* expansion
* contraction
* transition
* acceleration
* instability

These are _behaviours_, not geometric shapes.

Pulse Mini identifies these behaviours and shows when the environment is:

* clear
* directional
* noisy
* unstable
* worth engaging
* better to avoid

This behavioural reading replaces complex analysis with a clean, consistent interpretation of what the market is doing **right now**.

### Layered Interpretation Made Simple

Instead of interpreting dozens of signals, Pulse Mini organises behaviour into three intuitive layers:

* **Trend** → direction
* **Phase** → quality of movement
* **Timing** → micro-structure and momentum

These layers exist in every liquid market. Pulse Mini does not invent them — it reveals them.

Understanding how they interact allows you to make clearer, calmer, and more structured decisions.

### Consistency Across Markets and Timeframes

Pulse Mini adapts naturally across:

* BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, BNB
* 1H, 2H, 4H and 1D
* different volatility regimes

Because it reads _behaviour_, not formulas, the logic remains stable and consistent everywhere.

This makes the engine predictable in behaviour, even when markets are not.
