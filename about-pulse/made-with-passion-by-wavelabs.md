# Made with Passion by WaveLabs

Information about the project, the team, and the philosophy behind Pulse.

***

Every component of the Pulse Method — from Mini to future engines and the Dashboard — is built with a single purpose: **help traders understand the market without noise, without prediction, and without unnecessary complexity**.

WaveLabs is committed to creating tools that are:

* structurally honest
* consistently reliable
* behaviourally grounded
* modular and future-proof
* accessible to every trader

Pulse Mini is our first step in this ecosystem. It will always remain free, stable, and available to everyone.

If the Pulse Method becomes part of your workflow, our mission is fulfilled.
