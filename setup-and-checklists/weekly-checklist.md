# Weekly Checklist

A weekly reset keeps your perspective aligned with the broader market structure.\
It prevents tunnel vision, restores clarity, and reinforces discipline — especially in fast-moving markets like crypto.

Use this checklist once per week to recalibrate your workflow.

### Review the Macro Trend (1D)

Start from the **daily timeframe**:

* Identify the dominant direction
* Check whether momentum is strengthening or weakening
* Confirm the larger regime (bull, bear, transition)

A clean macro trend supports clearer conditions on lower timeframes.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Evaluate the Weekly Phase

Determine the phase at the start of the new week:

* **Expansion:** conditions are generally smoother
* **Contraction:** requires more patience
* **Transition:** higher risk of instability

Weeks beginning in compression often need extra caution.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Assess Market Stability

Look for signs of instability:

* sudden volatility spikes
* fragmented structure
* disruptive external events
* irregular timing windows

Stable weeks show smoother transitions; unstable weeks demand discretion.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Check the Golden Five

Review **BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, BNB** on the **1H**–**4H** range.

If most or all show clarity:

* the weekly environment is generally favourable
* your workflow can be more active
* signals tend to be more reliable

If the Golden Five look unstable, reduce aggression.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Clean Your Charts

Remove:

* old drawings
* unused indicators
* temporary analysis
* clutter from previous sessions

A clean chart improves objectivity and keeps your interpretation sharp.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Reset Your Rules

Revisit your **Daily Checklist** to restore discipline:

* Are you respecting structure?
* Are you avoiding impulsive entries?
* Are you reacting to noise or reading behaviour?

This keeps your mental framework aligned with the method.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Plan Your Week

Based on macro direction + weekly phase + Golden Five structure:

* decide if you will trade aggressively or conservatively
* identify potential high-quality environments
* predefine conditions to avoid

A planned week reduces emotional decisions and increases consistency.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Why the Weekly Checklist Works

This routine brings:

* clarity
* confidence
* structure
* discipline
* better long-term results

By stepping back once a week, you maintain perspective and give Pulse Mini the space to express its full clarity.
