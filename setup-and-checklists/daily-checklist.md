# Daily Checklist

Pulse Mini works best when used inside a stable, repeatable routine. This daily checklist helps you begin each session with clarity and maintain consistency throughout your workflow.

A full review takes less than two minutes.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Check the Trend

Start on **1H or 4H** and verify:

* Is the dominant direction clear?
* Is the trend stable or weakening?
* Are higher and lower timeframes aligned?

If the trend is flat or conflicting, reduce aggression or wait.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Check the Phase

Determine whether the market is:

* expanding
* contracting
* transitioning

Avoid compression zones and unstable mid-phases — these often lead to noise and low-quality conditions.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Check Timing Behaviour

Timing should support the broader structure.

* **Strong timing** → smoother continuation
* **Weak timing** → hesitation, exhaustion, instability

If timing contradicts trend or phase, step back.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Confirm the Symbol

Stay within the recommended markets, especially the **Golden Five**. They provide the cleanest structural reading.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Start from a Clear Timeframe

Begin your session on **1H**, **2H**, and **4H.** Move to lower timeframes only if higher timeframes are clean and aligned.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Respect the Environment

If the three layers (Trend, Phase, Timing) are misaligned:

* do nothing
* wait for the structure to return
* avoid forcing trades

Pulse Mini protects you by making uncertainty visible.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Why the Checklist Matters

This routine:

* resets emotional bias
* aligns your perspective
* strengthens discipline
* improves decision quality
* keeps your workflow consistent

A clean start leads to clearer decisions every day.
