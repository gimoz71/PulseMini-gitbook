# Setup Guide

***

**Pulse Mini** is most effective when used in markets and timeframes that naturally support clean structural behaviour.

This section provides a practical setup guide to ensure clarity, stability, and consistency while using the engine.

***

### Primary Markets

**Pulse Mini** works on any crypto market, but its structural clarity is strongest on the **Golden Five**:

* BTC/USDT
* ETH/USDT
* XRP/USDT
* SOL/USDT
* BNB/USDT

These pairs offer:

* deep liquidity
* smooth trend formation
* predictable behavioural cycles
* stable micro-structure

They represent the cleanest environment for learning and applying the Pulse Method.

***

### Secondary Markets

These markets are not intended for trading, but they provide useful **regime context**:

* USDT/USD
* USDC/USD

They help understand macro stability, but should not be used for **Pulse Mini** execution.

***

### Market Setup

The most reliable results come from markets that:

* show coherent trend development
* avoid chaotic micro-behaviour
* maintain consistent expansions/contractions
* limit distortion from cross-volatility

This is why the recommended setup is centred around the Golden Five. Other symbols can be explored, but they should be secondary to the core environment.

***

### Timeframes

**Pulse Mini** adapts to all TradingView timeframes, but clarity increases as noise decreases.

#### Core Timeframes

**1H**, **2H**, and **4H** provide the strongest combination of structure, readability, and stability.

#### Higher Timeframe

**1D** is useful for macro direction and understanding the broader regime.

#### Lower Timeframes

**15m** and **30m** are fully supported, but naturally more noisy. Recommended only once you are familiar with the engine’s behaviour.

***

### Why Timeframe Choice Matters

Lower timeframes produce:

* higher noise
* more false micro-swings
* unstable behaviour
* less consistent alignment of layers

Higher timeframes create:

* cleaner structure
* smoother transitions
* more reliable timing windows

**Pulse Mini** becomes more expressive as noise decreases.
