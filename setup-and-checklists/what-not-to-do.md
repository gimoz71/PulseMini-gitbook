# What Not to Do

Pulse Mini is designed to simplify and clarify your reading of the market. To maintain this clarity and avoid introducing noise, it’s important to avoid common habits that weaken structural interpretation.

This chapter outlines what _not_ to do when using the Pulse Method.

### Do Not Jump between Random Markets

Switching symbols constantly:

* breaks structural continuity
* disrupts your reading flow
* introduces unnecessary noise
* weakens consistency across sessions

Focus on the Golden Five unless you have a clear reason to explore alternatives.

### Do Not Use Ultra-Low Timeframes

Charts such as **1m**, **3m**, **5m** introduce heavy micro-noise. Pulse Mini remains functional, but clarity drops sharply, making the reading less reliable and far more reactive.

### Do Not Chase Every Move

Pulse Mini reveals structure, not micro-swings. If the engine is calm, it means the environment is not structurally favourable.

Chasing moves outside of alignment leads to:

* emotional entries
* low-quality trades
* reactive behaviour

### Do Not Overload Your Chart

Too many indicators, drawings, tools, or overlays:

* hide structural behaviour
* reduce readability
* create conflicting signals
* defeat the purpose of the method

A clean chart is a part of the Pulse philosophy.

### Do Not Force Trades when Layers Are Misaligned

When **trend**, **phase**, and **timing** disagree:

* the environment is unstable
* clarity is low
* risk is high

Misalignment is a structural signal to stand down.

### Do Not Ignore Higher Timeframes

Always review:

* **1H–4H** for structure
* **1D** for macro context

Skipping the higher-level view makes decisions less accurate and more reactive.

### Do Not Expect Prediction

Pulse Mini does **not** guess the future price. It reveals the present clearly — your judgment completes the process.

Expecting forecasting from a behavioural engine leads to misinterpretation and misuse.

### Why These Rules Matter

Avoiding these habits keeps your workflow:

* clean
* structured
* disciplined
* consistent
* aligned with real market behaviour

Pulse Mini protects you when you let it work — not when you fight the method.
