# Decision Matrix

The Decision Matrix is the internal process Pulse Mini uses to determine whether the market environment is structurally clear or unstable.

It does not rely on rigid rules, fixed thresholds, or predefined patterns. Instead, it evaluates how **Trend**, **Phase,** and **Timing** interact in real time.

Pulse Mini does not assign scores or probabilities. It reads **alignment**.

### How the Decision Matrix Works

The matrix continuously evaluates three conditions:

#### Trend as the Foundation

* stable → supportive
* weakening → caution
* flat → avoid

Trend defines the environment. If the trend is unclear, the rest becomes unreliable.

#### Phase as the Quality Filter

* clean expansion → structure
* contraction → noise
* transition → instability

Phase determines whether the environment has coherence.

#### Timing as the Confirmation Layer

* supportive → continuation likely
* hesitant → temporary instability
* reactive → avoid

Timing determines whether the moment itself supports action.

### Alignment vs Divergence

Pulse Mini expects **natural alignment**, not perfection.

A structured environment emerges when:

* Trend is directional
* Phase shows clean behaviour
* Timing supports the move

This alignment forms the basis for stable signals.

Divergence occurs when:

* trend weakens
* phase compresses
* timing becomes reactive

Divergence = instability. In these cases, the matrix shifts into caution and suppresses triggers.

### Why the Matrix Avoids Rigid Rules

Traditional systems use formulas like:

* MA crossovers
* RSI thresholds
* single-condition triggers

These tend to fire in noisy conditions and ignore structure.

Pulse Mini takes the opposite approach:

* no numeric thresholds
* no forced triggers
* no formula-based predictions

It evaluates coherence, not calculation.

### Why Pulse Mini Feels “Calm”

Because the matrix:

* avoids noisy environments
* waits for natural clarity
* suppresses low-quality signals
* filters out micro-volatility
* stays neutral during chaos

This behaviour is intentional. It keeps the engine non-repainting and stable across all markets.

### What the Decision Matrix Tells You

The matrix answers one core question: **“Is the market structurally readable right now?”**

* If yes → potential conditions
* If no → neutrality

It does _not_ command action. It reveals whether action is structurally justified.

### Summary

The Decision Matrix:

* does not guess
* does not forecast
* does not impose rules
* does not force signals

It simply identifies the moments when **Trend + Phase + Timing → structural coherence** and hides everything else.

This is what makes Pulse Mini a reliable behavioural engine rather than a reactive indicator.
