# Trend Layer

The Trend Layer is the backbone of Pulse Mini’s structural reading. It identifies the dominant direction of the market and establishes the broad environment in which all other behaviours develop.

Pulse Mini does **not** calculate trend using moving averages, smoothing functions, or regression models. It reads trend as **behaviour** — directly from price.

### What the Trend Layer Measures

The trend layer evaluates:

* directional continuity
* coherence between swings
* stability of slope
* strength vs weakening behaviour
* preservation or loss of directional rhythm

When these elements align, the trend becomes readable and reliable.

### When Trend Is Clear

A clear trend appears when:

* price moves with a consistent rhythm
* pullbacks are controlled
* volatility supports direction
* structural breaks are minimal

In a clear trend:

* the environment becomes easier to read
* timing follows more naturally
* phase transitions are smoother

Pulse Mini tends to be more expressive when the trend is stable.

### When Trend Weakens

Trend weakness appears when:

* slope flattens
* swings lose coherence
* volatility spikes disrupt structure
* price compresses or hesitates

When trend weakens:

* structural clarity drops
* alignment across layers becomes rare
* the engine reduces activity by design

A weakening trend is often the first sign of an unstable environment.

### Why Trend Matters for the Method

Trend determines:

* the directional context for Phase
* the likelihood of clean timing
* the quality of structural behaviour

Without a clear trend:

* Phase becomes ambiguous
* Timing becomes reactive
* Signals become less reliable

Trend is not a trading signal — it is the **structural foundation**.

### How Traders Use the Trend Layer

Traders look at the trend layer to:

* understand the overall environment
* avoid counter-structural trades
* avoid forced entries during weak or flat trends
* favour clarity over frequency
* identify when the market deserves attention

Trend answers the question: **“Is the market moving in a direction or not?”**

### Summary

The Trend Layer is the first filter in Pulse Mini’s interpretation. It does not predict — it reveals.

A stable trend supports:

* cleaner structure
* smoother timing
* clearer signals

A weak or flat trend warns you to slow down, be patient, or step aside.

Trend is the beginning of all structural reading.
