# Market Context

This section contains the full technical documentation of the Pulse engine layers. These are detailed and structured references for advanced users and developers.

***

Market Context is the broad structural environment in which the price is moving. It is the foundation of Pulse Mini’s reading, influencing how Trend, Phase, and Timing behave, and how clearly they can align.

Pulse Mini does not label context explicitly — it reacts to it.

***

### What Market Context Represents

Market context reflects the underlying conditions that shape behaviour, including:

* trend strength
* volatility behaviour
* expansion and contraction cycles
* transitions between states
* stability vs fragmentation

These elements determine whether the market is expressing a clean structure or unstable noise.

***

### Stable Context

A stable context appears when:

* direction is clear
* volatility behaves consistently
* swings have coherence
* expansions and contractions follow a readable rhythm

In these environments:

* alignment between layers becomes more frequent
* signals are clearer
* structural behaviour is easier to follow

Stable context is where Pulse Mini expresses maximum clarity.

***

### Unstable Context

Unstable context emerges when:

* volatility spikes unexpectedly
* price compresses tightly
* micro-swings become erratic
* timing breaks or becomes reactive
* transitions occur rapidly and without rhythm

During an unstable context:

* alignment becomes rare
* signals decrease
* caution increases naturally
* the engine becomes more neutral

Pulse Mini does not force structure where none exists.

***

### Why Market Context Matters

Market context determines how the engine interprets the other layers:

* Trend becomes weaker or stronger depending on context
* Phase becomes cleaner or noisier
* Timing becomes supportive or hesitant

Context shapes structure. Structure shapes signals.

This is why Pulse Mini behaves differently in different environments — the engine reads what reality presents, not what fixed rules expect.

***

### How Traders Use Context

Traders can use context to:

* adjust trade aggression
* decide when to be patient
* identify market regime shifts
* filter out low-quality environments
* avoid periods dominated by noise

Context does not tell you what to trade — it tells you whether the market deserves attention.

***

### Summary

Market context is the invisible frame behind Pulse Mini’s clarity. It is not a rule, not an indicator, and not a prediction — it is the environment that determines how structure forms.

Pulse Mini adapts to context naturally:

* **Stable context** → more expressive engine
* **Unstable context** → more conservative engine

This is by design.
