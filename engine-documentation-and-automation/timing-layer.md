# Timing Layer

The Timing Layer captures **short-term behaviour**, **micro-structure**, and the **immediate rhythm** of price movement.

While Trend shows direction and Phase shows structural quality, Timing reveals whether the _moment itself_ supports action or signals hesitation.

It is the final confirmation layer before a structural signal can appear.

### What the Timing Layer Measures

Timing evaluates:

* momentum continuity
* micro-volatility behaviour
* immediate structural coherence
* acceleration vs exhaustion
* short-term flow vs short-term disruption

Timing is not about speed — it’s about **stability and alignment**.

***

### When Timing Is Strong

Strong timing appears when:

* short-term behaviour supports the broader trend
* volatility flows smoothly
* micro-swings follow structural rhythm
* momentum is consistent
* price behaves with clarity across small cycles

In these conditions:

* continuation is more likely
* alignment across layers improves
* the environment supports decision-making

Strong timing is a sign of structural health.

***

### When Timing Weakens

Weak timing is one of the earliest signs of instability.

It appears when:

* micro-swings become erratic
* momentum hesitates
* volatility spikes irrationally
* structural rhythm breaks
* behaviour becomes reactive

Weak timing warns that the price may:

* stall
* reverse
* compress
* or produce low-quality conditions

**Pulse Mini** becomes more cautious when timing weakens — even if trend and phase appear supportive.

***

### Timing as a Stability Filter

Timing is not designed to generate rapid-fire signals. It is a **stability filter** that prevents action when behaviour is inconsistent.

It helps avoid:

* entering too early
* entering into exhaustion
* entering during reactive mini-swings
* entering during micro-volatility bursts

Timing ensures that the moment itself is structurally sound.

***

### How Traders Use the Timing Layer

Traders rely on timing to:

* refine entry conditions
* detect when the market is hesitating
* avoid trades during instability
* validate short-term alignment
* confirm that momentum supports structural behaviour

Timing answers the question: **“Is this moment stable enough to act?”**

***

### Summary

The Timing Layer is **Pulse Mini**’s moment-to-moment filter.

* **Strong Timing** → support
* **Weak Timing** → caution

Together:

* Trend shows direction
* Phase shows structural quality
* Timing shows momentary stability

These layers create the foundation for high-quality structural signals.
