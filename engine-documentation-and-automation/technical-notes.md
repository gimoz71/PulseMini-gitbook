# Technical Notes

Pulse Mini is not built on classical indicators or oscillators. It does not rely on:

* moving averages
* RSI, MACD, Stochastics
* volatility bands
* smoothing filters
* regression models
* statistical forecasting

Instead, the engine reads **price behaviour directly**, using structural dynamics that occur naturally in all liquid markets.

These technical notes clarify how the engine works internally and why it behaves differently from traditional TA tools.

### Behavioural Logic Instead of Formulas

Pulse Mini evaluates:

* expansion and contraction behaviour
* directional stability
* volatility rhythm
* transitional phases
* continuity vs exhaustion
* micro-structure coherence

These elements are observable phenomena, not mathematical abstractions. Because behaviour is universal across markets, the engine remains:

* robust
* consistent
* non-repainting
* stable across timeframes

Pulse does not approximate structure — it reads it.

### Why Pulse Mini Is Non-Repainting

Pulse Mini never:

* revises historical triggers
* redraws previous conditions
* recalculates past bars
* modifies the structural state retroactively

Signals and conditions reflect the market **exactly as it was** at the time they appeared.

This guarantees mechanical consistency and prevents misleading history.

### Why Pulse Mini Avoids Predictive Mathematics

Regression and statistical forecasting assume:

* stable volatility
* regular distributions
* consistent cycles
* stationary behaviour

Crypto markets violate these assumptions constantly. This makes predictive models unstable and unreliable.

Pulse Mini avoids prediction entirely. It focuses on **measurement**, not anticipation.

Behavioural measurement is:

* more resilient
* less prone to error
* immune to regime shifts
* valid across any market condition

This keeps the engine truthful to real market behaviour.

### Why Pulse Does Not Use Moving Averages

Moving averages:

* lag
* smooth noise instead of reading structure
* break under high volatility
* create false reversals during compression
* obscure real behaviour

Pulse Mini reads **raw market structure**, which is more accurate than any smoothed derivative of price.

* **Structure** → truth
* **Smoothing** → distortion

### Structural Invariance across Timeframes

Pulse Mini maintains the same internal logic on 1H, 2H, 4H, and 1D. This is possible because:

* behaviour scales
* structure scales
* volatility cycles scale

Pulse does not adapt parameters. It reads behaviour consistently across all time horizons.

### Micro-Structure and Noise Handling

Pulse Mini is designed to ignore:

* micro-noise
* erratic swings
* reactive volatility
* weak impulses
* short, disconnected movements

This reduces false positives and keeps visual clarity high. The engine activates only when the structure becomes coherent.

### Importance of Behavioural Anchoring

Because Pulse Mini anchors its reading to behaviour rather than formulas, it works:

* in trends
* in expansions
* in transitions
* across volatility regimes

…and remains consistent even in aggressive, irregular, or fast markets.

This behavioural foundation is the core technical philosophy of the Pulse Method.

### Summary

Pulse Mini’s technical architecture is built on:

* raw behavioural reading
* structural consistency
* non-repainting logic
* avoidance of prediction
* universal scaling across timeframes
* deep noise filtering

Traditional indicators compute. Pulse Mini **interprets**. This is the engine’s technical advantage.
