# Getting Started

This section guides you through your first steps with Pulse Mini: installation, setup, reading your first signals, and understanding the essential tools. It helps you become operational quickly and confidently.

***

Pulse Mini runs directly inside TradingView and is designed to be easy to install and simple to use from the very first moment.

This section guides you through:

* adding Pulse Mini to your chart
* understanding the default configuration
* preparing your workspace for the clearest experience

### What to Expect on First Install

When you load Pulse Mini for the first time, the engine:

* automatically applies its default settings
* displays the Trend, Phase and Timing layers
* adapts to your current chart timeframe
* remains lightweight and non-intrusive

No configuration is needed to begin reading the market.

### Recommended First Steps

To get the cleanest and most accurate first impression:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Open a recommended market

Choose one of the core high-liquidity crypto pairs:\
BTC/USDT — ETH/USDT — XRP/USDT — SOL/USDT — BNB/USDT
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Use a clean timeframe

Start with 1H, 2H, or 4H for the most stable structure.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Remove unnecessary indicators

Pulse Mini works with any chart setup, but too many tools reduce clarity. A clean chart shows the engine’s structure best.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Check that all layers are visible

Trend, Phase, and Timing should appear automatically.\
If something looks off → refresh or toggle the indicator once.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### What Happens after Setup

Once Pulse Mini is active:

* the chart reorganises into a clean structural view
* trend behaviour becomes clear at a glance
* phase shifts and timing windows stand out naturally
* signals appear only when the environment aligns

You are now ready to begin reading your first conditions and understanding the structural behaviour of the market.

### No Commitment Required

Pulse Mini can be used:

* manually
* with alerts
* with or without automation
* on any TradingView plan

There is no setup complexity and no risk of altering your existing workflow.
