# Behavioural Reading

**Pulse** does not use regression, statistical forecasting, or econometric modeling. Instead, it reads markets through **behaviour** — the most direct, reliable, and observable form of market information.

Behavioural Reading is the foundation of the Pulse Method. It focuses on recurring structural behaviours rather than predicting outcomes.

**Pulse Mini** is the purest expression of this approach.

### Markets Cannot Be Predicted — But They Can Be Read

Price does not move randomly. It follows recurring behavioural dynamics:

* direction and momentum
* compression and expansion
* transitions and instability
* loss or preservation of structural cohesion

These behaviours do not repeat identically, but they follow recognisable rhythms.

Pulse is designed to read what the market is doing **right now**, without forcing it into predictive formulas.

### Why Pulse Focuses on Behaviour, Not Forecasting

Many systems attempt to forecast price using:

* linear/polynomial regression
* statistical projections
* econometric models
* curve fitting

These techniques assume:

* stable volatility
* stationary behaviour
* predictable distributions

Crypto markets violate all these assumptions:

* volatility is non-stationary
* outliers dominate returns
* regime shifts appear abruptly
* behavioural cycles mutate rapidly
* correlations break frequently

Forecasting becomes fragile. Behaviour remains reliable.

***

### Structural Behaviour as the Core Signal

Pulse reads:

* directional continuity
* rhythm and slope
* structural quality
* pullback depth and frequency
* expansion vs contraction
* timing behaviour

It measures behaviour instead of predicting movement.

This produces:

* cleaner structure
* non-repainting logic
* stable interpretation
* cross-market consistency

The method becomes durable, even in harsh environments.

***

### Isolating Real Direction

Pulse isolates direction through behavioural characteristics:

* continuity of movement
* coherence between swings
* stability of rhythm
* depth of corrections
* preservation or breakdown of slope

No moving averages. No smoothing formulas. No model fitting.

Direction is **observed**, not calculated.

***

### Avoiding Mathematical Prediction

Pulse avoids regression and statistical models not because they are “wrong”, but because **markets consistently violate their assumptions.**

As Kaufman would say:

Pulse measures behaviour. It does not forecast it.

### Mini as the Purest Form of Behavioural Reading

Pulse Mini applies the method with no predictive components:

* recognising recurring behavioural patterns
* isolating real market direction
* highlighting clear vs unstable conditions
* filtering chaotic environments
* reading structure and coherence in real time

Mini does not use:

* statistical forecasting
* regression models
* prediction engines
* smoothing or recalculation

It reads. It does not guess.

This makes Pulse Mini:

* simple
* consistent
* non-repainting
* structurally honest
* aligned with the core philosophy of the Method
