# Multi-Layer Framework

Pulse Mini organises market behaviour into **three simplified structural layers**. Each layer captures a different dimension of price movement, and together they form the backbone of Pulse’s behavioural reading.

The goal is simple: understand the environment quickly and focus only on conditions that make sense.

***

### Trend — Direction of Movement

The **Trend layer** shows the dominant directional bias of the market.

It helps you understand whether the environment favours:

* long positions
* short positions
* or a neutral, cautious stance

A **stable, clean trend** creates clearer structural conditions. A **weakening or flattening trend** often signals hesitation and reduced clarity.

Pulse Mini identifies trend as **behaviour**, not as a moving average or smoothing formula.

***

### Phase — Quality of Movement

The **Phase layer** reflects how the market is moving within the trend.

It highlights whether the price is in:

* expansion
* contraction
* consolidation
* transition

This layer helps you avoid environments where structure becomes unreliable, such as:

* tight ranges
* unstable mid-points
* noisy transitions

With a clean phase, the structure supports action. With a chaotic one, it's better to stay cautious.

***

### Timing — Rhythm and Micro-Structure

The **Timing layer** captures short-term behaviour and momentum.

It shows whether current conditions support continuation or signal hesitation:

* **Strong timing** → momentum aligns with trend and phase
* **Weak timing** → the market hesitates, exhausts, or fragments

Even in a strong trend, poor timing can weaken the environment.

Timing is not about generating rapid triggers — it is a **stability filter** that helps avoid reactive or impulsive conditions.

### Layer Alignment — The Core of Pulse Mini

You do not need complex rules to read these layers.

Simply observe:

* when they align, the structure is clear
* when they diverge, the structure weakens or breaks

Aligned layers form naturally. They are not forced by formulas or thresholds. This is what makes Pulse Mini intuitive, stable, and non-repainting.
