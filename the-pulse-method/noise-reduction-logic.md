# Noise Reduction Logic

Most price movements are noise — small fluctuations, unstable micro-swings and reactions that do not reflect meaningful structure. Traditional indicators often react to this noise, creating misleading or low-value signals.

**Pulse Mini** takes the opposite approach. Its purpose is to show **only the structural information that consistently matters**.

***

### Designed to Ignore Irrelevant Movements

**Pulse Mini** filters out:

* random volatility spikes
* micro-swings
* chaotic fluctuations
* false impulses
* unstable transitions
* compression noise

These behaviours distort traditional indicators, but **Pulse Mini** is built to ignore them.

***

### Focus on Structural Elements

Instead of reacting to every price movement, **Pulse Mini** evaluates:

* directional stability
* phase behaviour
* timing rhythm
* expansion vs contraction
* structural continuity

If these elements do not align, the engine prefers to remain neutral. Neutrality is a feature — not a limitation.

### Why Noise Filtering Matters

Noise is responsible for:

* impulse trades
* false entries
* emotional decisions
* strategy inconsistency
* overtrading
* sudden reversals

By filtering noise, **Pulse Mini**:

* protects you from low-quality environments
* reduces emotional trading
* improves consistency
* clarifies the underlying behaviour of the market

You see only what is meaningful — nothing more.

### Non-Repainting Behaviour

Because **Pulse Mini** focuses on structure rather than indicators:

* it does **not** recalculate past signals
* it does **not** adjust previous candles
* it does **not** shift entries after confirmation

What you see is what the market produced at that moment.

This is why the engine remains stable across:

* volatility shifts
* timeframes
* markets
* noisy conditions

Its clarity comes from behaviour, not formulas.
