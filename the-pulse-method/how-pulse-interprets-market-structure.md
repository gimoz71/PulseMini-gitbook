# How Pulse Interprets Market Structure

Here you will find the complete explanation of the Pulse Method: the behavioural and structural logic that powers the engine. This section provides the conceptual framework behind Pulse Mini’s accuracy and stability.

***

Pulse Mini reads the market through the lens of **real behaviour**, not through synthetic indicators or predictive formulas.

Its interpretation is built on three foundational elements that appear in all liquid markets:

* **Trend** → direction of movement
* **Phase** → quality and organisation of movement
* **Timing** → rhythm and micro-structure&#x20;

These layers work together to form a consistent structural map of the environment.

Pulse Mini does not analyse price with indicators — it observes how price behaves.

### Structure over Indicators

Traditional indicators often:

* smooth price artificially
* introduce lag
* produce conflicting signals
* react to noise instead of suppressing it&#x20;

Pulse Mini takes the opposite approach:

* no smoothing
* no oscillators
* no regressions
* no forecasts&#x20;

Instead, it reads the _natural organisation of price_ as it unfolds.

### Present-Focused Interpretation

Pulse Mini focuses exclusively on the **current environment**, evaluating:

* directional stability
* expansion vs contraction
* continuity of movement
* micro-structure rhythm
* transition points
* instability or fragmentation

It does not guess what’s next — it reveals what is happening now.

Clean behaviour today is more actionable than a prediction about tomorrow.

### Alignment as a Structural Signal

Pulse Mini does not produce signals from a single condition. A structural confirmation appears only when:

* Trend is aligned
* Phase is clean
* Timing supports action

This natural alignment reflects moments when the market shows coherence.

When layers diverge, structure breaks, and the engine stays neutral. This keeps Pulse Mini:

* stable
* consistent
* non-repainting
* resistant to noise

### A Universal Interpretation Model

Because Pulse Mini reads structure directly from price, it adapts smoothly across:

* different markets
* different timeframes
* low-volatility and high-volatility conditions

The behavioural principles remain valid everywhere. The market changes — the method does not.
